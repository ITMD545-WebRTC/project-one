323 new cases in Ireland
NOTE: \"HPSC has been notified of 334 confirmed cases of COVID-19. There has now been a total of 33,444* confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ireland. (*Validation of data at the HPSC has resulted in the denotification of 12 confirmed cases. The figure of 33,444 confirmed cases reflects this.)
Of the cases notified today: 158 are men and 175 are women\" [source] 
 
Since Ireland's Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) maintains historical data for daily cases and total cases that are in conflict with one another [source] (no adjustment of historical data is made when denotifications or backlogs occur, such as today) and, furthermore, there are slight discrepancies between the reported new cases (334), the sum of new cases by sex (158+175 = 333) and the arithmetical difference between today's total cumulative cases and yesterday's total after applying the 12 case denotification (33,444-33,109 = 335), Worldometer has updated based on the new total cases, which yelds a daily change of 323, representing the daily change in cumulative reported cases [source]
